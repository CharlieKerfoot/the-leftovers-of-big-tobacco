						10 days prior, acclaimed animator and film producer, Walt Disney,
						had just celebrated his birthday. Now he lay dead, 30 minutes from
						his home in Los Angeles, in a bed at Saint Joseph Hospital. The
						following day, his funeral would be held and on December 17th, he
						would be cremated with his ashes interred at Forest Lawn Memorial
						Park.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<p>
						It wasn't a freak accident or a tragic event. It was far more
						ordinary and far more telling of the times.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="4">
					<p>
						Like millions of other Americans, Walt Disney had been a lifelong
						smoker. His addiction began in his early 20s while serving as an
						ambulance driver for the Red Cross in France during World War I. The
						long, empty stretches of duty in a postwar Europe offered little
						distraction, so cigarettes filled the void. He loved the feeling
						they gave him, the focus and power that came with a Brown
						Chesterfield in between his restless fingers. Even his daughter said
						she "<a
							href="https://mouseplanet.com/walts-smoking-and-infamous-cough/4317/#google_vignette"
							>couldn't picture him without a cigarette</a
						>".
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="5">
					<p>
						As I'm sure you've guessed, the reason for his passing was of course
						complications relating to his smoking. His official autopsy cited
						"circulatory collapse caused by his lung cancer". Smoking caught up
						to even the most magical of men.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="6">
					<p>
						Disney's story was tragically unexceptional. In 1966, 42.6% of
						American adults smoked, only slightly down from the 1954 peak of
						45.3%. Smoking was a cultural norm, embedded into advertising,
						cinema, workplaces, and even hospitals. Cigarettes were marketed as
						symbols of masculinity, sophistication, and calm. Rarely were they
						seen as lethal.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-step="7">
					<p>
						Walt Disney's death mirrored the silent epidemic already claiming
						hundreds of thousands of lives each year. His passing didn't just
						mark the end of an era of animation; it marked a public health
						moment that, over time, would catalyze a shift in how America viewed
						smoking and health.

		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				Now, almost 60 years later, smoking seems, for the most part, to be a
				problem of the past. The number of smokers in the U.S. has plummeted
				from 42.6% in 1966 to just 11.5% in 2021, according to the CDC.
				Cigarette ads are banned on TV, smoking is prohibited in most public
				spaces, and nearly every American understands the deadly risks of
				tobacco.
			</p>

			<p>But while one public health crisis receded, another emerged.</p>

			<p>
				Today, 42% of American adults are obese, a statistic eerily similar to
				the smoking rate of the mid-20th century. Once again, we find ourselves
				in the midst of a slow-motion epidemic—one not driven by cigarettes, but
				by food.
			</p>

			<p>
				In recent decades, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have come to dominate
				the American diet. These are not just snacks or fast food—they're food
				products that are chemically altered and engineered for maximum shelf
				life, convenience, and hyper-palatability. Think frozen dinners, sugary
				cereals, flavored chips, sodas, protein bars, and even "health" foods
				like flavored yogurt or granola.
			</p>

			<p>
				UPFs now account for over 60% of the calories consumed by the average
				American adult—and nearly 70% for children, according to research
				published in the BMJ and JAMA Network. These foods are often stripped of
				fiber and nutrients, packed with added sugars, artificial ingredients,
				and emulsifiers, and designed to override our satiety signals.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapter-title" style="margin-top: 5rem">SALAD</div>

		<div class="text-content">
			<p>Ok... so now what? Isn't that 42% stat just a coincidence?</p>

			<p>
				Not necessarily. In fact, I am almost certain that this isn't a
				coincidence. Let's see why.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 1985, R.J. Reynolds, the largest tobacco company in the United
				States, merged with snack giant Nabisco to form RJR Nabisco. 3 years
				later, Philip Morris, the producer of the cigarette brands Marlboro,
				L&M, and Chesterfield, acquired Kraft foods. At the time, they were also
				the owners of General Foods.
			</p>

			<p>
				With the American public worried about smoking and the NIH's crosshair
				pointed right at them, Big Tobacco jumped ship in favor of the food
				industry. In the span of three years, the two largest cigarette
				companies in the world bought a large massive portion of the food and
				snack industry. Many of your favorite snack items are likely owned by
				the successors of these companies.
			</p>

			<p>
				The crucial point of this shift, though, was that they had maintained
				their same business strategy from the smoking business for food.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>ADDICTION</strong><br />
				They leveraged ultra-processed, hyper-palatable ingredients and
				chemicals to make their customers as addicted as their previous
				cigarette victims.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapter-title" style="margin-top: 5rem">ENTREES</div>

		<div id="calories-viz" class="viz"></div>

		<div class="graph-description">
			<p>
				This first visualization paints a picture of how the American diet has
				evolved over the past 40 years. In 1980, ultra-processed foods accounted
				for about 30 percent of daily calories. Fast forward to 2020, and that
				number has skyrocketed to over 50 percent. During that same period, the
				percentage of calories from unprocessed or minimally processed foods has
				steadily declined. What this means is that more and more of what we eat
				is made not from whole ingredients but from industrial formulations
				packed with additives, preservatives, and artificial flavors. The green
				section representing unprocessed foods has been shrinking, while the
				orange section for ultra-processed foods has taken over the majority of
				the plate. This shift reflects a larger trend in modern food culture:
				convenience and shelf life have largely overtaken nutritional quality.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="smokers-viz" class="viz"></div>

		<div class="graph-description">
			<p>
				The second visualization provides a clear link between smoking and UPF
				consumption. It breaks down how often Americans eat various categories
				of ultra-processed food depending on their smoking status. What it shows
				is alarming: current smokers consistently consume more UPFs than both
				former and never smokers across every single category.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Frozen meals and pizza?</strong> Smokers eat them more
					frequently.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Sugary drinks?</strong> Smokers top the charts.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Processed snacks, fast food, breakfast cereal?</strong> Same
					story.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="text-content">
			<p>Together, these two visuals tell a cohesive story.</p>
			<p>
				The companies that once marketed cigarettes with cowboy swagger and
				sophistication not sell taste. And their mastery of human impulse, honed
				through decades of addiction science, has been redirected into the
				supermarket aisle.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="chapter-title" style="margin-top: 5rem">DESSERT</div>
		<div class="text-content">
			<p>
				What we're seeing is not just a public health shift, but a corporate
				rebranding of addiction.
			</p>

			<p>
				The American public, in many ways, traded one form of self-destruction
				for another. It may be less obvious, but it seems to be just as
				engineered. The death rate from lung cancer may have dropped, but the
				rates of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity-related illness are
				soaring.
			</p>

			<p>
				The cigarette was easy to spot. It burned, it smelled, and it stained
				your fingers. Ultra-processed food is much harder to identify and even
				harder to resist. It doesn't kill you quickly. It just quietly rewires
				your body and transforms your brain, one bite at a time.
			</p>

			<p>We're all just suffering from the leftovers of big tobacco.</p>
