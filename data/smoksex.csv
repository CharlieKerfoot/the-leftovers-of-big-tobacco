"* Estimates are considered unreliable. Starting with 2016 data, the reliability of survey percentage estimates is assessed using new multistep National Center for Health Statistics data presentation standards for proportions. Before 2016 data, the reliability of estimates was evaluated based on relative standard errors (RSEs). Data preceded by an asterisk have an RSE of 20%–30%. Data not shown have an RSE greater than 30%. For more information, see Sources and Definitions, Relative standard error (RSE); Statistical reliability of estimates.
\1Estimates are age adjusted to the year 2000 standard population using five age groups: 18–24 years, 25–34 years, 35–44 years, 45–64 years, and 65 years and over. Age-adjusted estimates in this table may differ from other age-adjusted estimates based on the same data and presented elsewhere if different age groups are used in the adjustment procedure. See Sources and Definitions, Age adjustment.
\2Includes unknown sex and unknown race.
\3The race groups White and Black include people of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin. Starting with 1999 data, race-specific estimates are tabulated according to the 1997 “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” and are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. The single-race categories shown in the table follow the 1997 standards. Starting with 1999 data, race-specific estimates are for people who reported only one racial group. Before 1999, data were tabulated according to the 1977 standards. Estimates for single-race categories before 1999 included people who reported one race or, if they reported more than one race, identified one race as best representing their race. Starting with 2003 data, race responses of other race and unspecified multiple race are treated as missing, and then race is imputed if these were the only race responses. Almost all people with a race response of other race are of Hispanic origin. See Sources and Definitions, Hispanic origin; Race.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTES: Starting with 1993 data (shown in spreadsheet version), current cigarette smokers are defined as ever smoking 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and smoking now every day or some days. For the previous definition, see Sources and Definitions, Tobacco use. Data before 1997 are not strictly comparable with data for later years due to the 1997 questionnaire redesign. In 2019, the NHIS questionnaire was redesigned and other changes were made to weighting and design methodology. Data for 2019 have not been fully evaluated for comparability with earlier years. For more information on the 2019 NHIS redesign and evaluation of the redesign on selected indicators, see: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2019_quest_redesign.htm. Standard errors (SEs) and data for additional years are available in the Excel spreadsheet version of this table on the Health, United States website at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/index.htm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
